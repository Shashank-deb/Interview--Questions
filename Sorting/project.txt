I have done three project 
1.ONLINE EDURA
&application -Used in educational community or any college to serve as the modules provider
providing the platform of education very helpful website in educational community as concern



&libraries-in front end i basically used the legacy jquery library to compute the table data with 
ajax functionality

&why you used this tech stack-because i am in learning phase and know the html ,css and javascript
that make me to use this tech stack and as a begineer if you not know any framework then 
it is best to go for building the website with html,css and javascript combination.


&working-developing the front end of the website and this is group project
iam responsible for the developing of login,logout ,registration ,feedback modules.



&unique-every educational website have the several modules of related community and every
educational website is linked with each other having the change of ui
so their is no uniquness in my website.









2.MONTY HALL Game


&application -There are no useful real life examples or analogies that 
we can use to properly compare the Monty Hall Problem to, which is actually
why the problem seems so anti-intuitive to us.


&libraries-libgdx library for java game development


&why you used this tech stack-sir the answer is that we as a team found that most of 
the game build in c and c++ and even most build in python tech stack so we as i team
want to build this game in java so i found that their is the library named as libgdx and
we make that game



&working-the working of the monty hall game is based on 'bayes theoerm'


&unique-the uniqueness is the techstack itself on one in the internet will build
that game in java
